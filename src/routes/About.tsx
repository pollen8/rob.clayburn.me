   <p style={{marginTop: '1rem'}}>
    A full-stack web developer with 20 years of experience dedicated to creating and delivering unique web experiences,
    I love thinking out of the box and delighting my clients.

      As a confident communicator I have presented at several industry events.

    <p>
      Outside of work I am a total badminton nerd. I've played national division 3 in France, coaching and revitalising the junior section 
      in the La Rochelle club during the same period. Now I'm back in the UK and somewhat older I play County veterans, and am embarking on 
      running my new club's junior badminton section.

    <p>Coaching draws a lot of parallels with agile development whereby a short cyclical process can produce the greatest improvements.
      You need to analyse the situation, figure out needs and suggest improvements and observe if your suggestions are working. 
      If not, change the advice and repeat the process. 
      What I find fascinating is the different ways each of us learns and I get a real buzz when some new skill clicks with a student.
