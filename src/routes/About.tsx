   <p style={{marginTop: '1rem'}}>
    A full-stack web developer with 20 years of experience dedicated to creating and delivering unique web experiences,
    I love thinking out of the box and delighting my clients.

      As a confident communicator I have presented at several industry events.

    <p>
      Outside of work I am a total badminton nerd. I've played national division 3 in France, coaching and revitalising the junior section 
      in the La Rochelle club during the same period. Now I'm back in the UK and somewhat older I play County veterans, and am embarking on 
      running my new club's junior badminton section.

    <p>Coaching draws a lot of parallels with agile development in that short cyclical feedback loops produce amazing improvements.
      You need to analyse the situation, figure out the players needs, suggest improvements and observe if your suggestions are working. 
      If not, change the advice and repeat the process.</p>
      <p>
      I find the different ways each of us learns fascinating and get a real buzz when a new skill clicks with a student.
