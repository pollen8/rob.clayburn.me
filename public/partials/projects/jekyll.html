		<h3>The Project</h3>
		<p><a itemprop="url" href="http://slingshoteffect.co.uk">Slingshot</a> wanted to create an experience 
		using technology and historic resources based around the
		book &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; Players should experience
		the cult novel in a new and innovative environment, transcending characters, 
		themes and narrative to reveal, and release, their inner Hyde.
		</p>
		<h3>My work</h3>
		<p><img itemprop="image" src="images/Jekyll_and_HydeS_Shot.jpg" alt="Jekyll" class="img-rounded" />
		I was charged with taking a 
		<a href="http://zephyranywhere.com/products/bioharness-3/">Zephyr bio harness&apos;s</a>
		biometric data, routed through an <a href="https://electricimp.com/">electric imp</a>, 
		to control the playback of the game's HTML5 video and audio sources.
		This enabled the game player to play, pause and restart videos by holding their breaths.</p>
